      <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>I specialize in building intelligent, data-driven solutions using AI and machine learning.
       My expertise includes deep learning, NLP, and automation to enhance decision-making and optimize processes.
       As a MERN Stack developer, I create scalable full-stack applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js,
       ensuring high performance and seamless user experiences.
       I am passionate about mentoring and upskilling developers, delivering hands-on training in AI, web development,
       and programming with a practical, real-world approach.
       I create intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces, combining modern design principles with seamless user 
       experience to enhance digital products.Machine learning (ML) allows computers to learn and make decisions without
        being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding data into algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions 
        on new data. It is used in various applications like image recognition, speech processing, language translation, 
        recommender systems, etc. In this article, we will see more about ML and its core concepts.</p>
        <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) trains an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
        Instead of being told the correct answers, agent learns by trial and error method and gets rewards
        for good actions and penalties for bad ones. Over time it develops a strategy to maximize rewards
        and achieve goals. This approach is good for problems having sequential decision making such as
        robotics, gaming and autonomous systems.
        Example: While Identifying a Fruit, system receives an input for example an apple and initially makes an
        incorrect prediction like "It's a mango". Feedback is provided to correct the error "Wrong! It's an apple"
        and the system updates its model based on this feedback.
        Over time it learns to respond correctly that "It's an apple" when getting similar inputs and also improves accuracy.</p>
        <p>Python language is widely used in Machine Learning because it provides libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn,
        TensorFlow, and Keras. These libraries offer tools and functions essential for data manipulation, analysis, and 
        building machine learning models. It is well-known for its readability and offers platform independence. These all 
        things make it the perfect language of choice for Machine Learning.</p>
        <p>Machine Learning is a subdomain of artificial intelligence. It allows computers to learn and improve from 
        experience without being explicitly programmed, and It is designed in such a way that allows systems to 
        identify patterns, make predictions, and make decisions based on data.
        So, let's start Python Machine Learning guide to learn more about ML.</p>
